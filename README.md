The PetInfo QR application is a full-stack web application designed to store and display essential pet information through a scannable QR code.
Each QR code links to a unique profile containing a pet’s name, breed, age, vaccination history, allergies, and owner contact information. 
The goal is to make it easier for pet owners, veterinarians, and shelters to quickly access critical information about a pet in emergencies.
